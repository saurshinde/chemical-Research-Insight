The ABS Resins Recycling Market focuses on the process of recycling Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) resins, a commonly used plastic material in various industries, such as automotive, electronics, consumer goods, and more. ABS resins are known for their strength, impact resistance, and moldability, making them ideal for products like automobile dashboards, household appliances, and electronics enclosures.

Recycling ABS resins involves converting post-consumer and post-industrial ABS plastic waste into reusable forms, which can then be used to produce new products. This process generally includes several steps such as sorting, cleaning, melt extrusion, and compounding. The goal of recycling ABS is to reduce environmental impact, cut down on waste, and make the material reusable in a closed-loop production cycle.
