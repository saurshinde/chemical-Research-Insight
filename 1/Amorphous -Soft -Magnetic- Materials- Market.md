Amorphous soft magnetic materials are materials that exhibit high magnetic permeability and can be easily magnetized and demagnetized. These materials are primarily used in electronic devices that require efficient magnetic properties. Amorphous materials, unlike crystalline structures, lack a regular atomic arrangement, making them unique in their ability to minimize energy losses during magnetic switching. They are typically characterized by low coercivity, low remnant magnetization, low eddy current losses, and low hysteresis losses. These properties make them ideal for high-performance applications such as transformers, magnetic shielding, sensors, high-frequency inductors, and electronic article surveillance systems.

The non-crystalline structure of these materials allows for a combination of high efficiency, energy conservation, and improved performance in various applications. Iron-based, Fe-Ni-based, and cobalt-based alloys are the most commonly used types of amorphous soft magnetic materials, each suited for different industrial applications depending on their magnetic properties.
