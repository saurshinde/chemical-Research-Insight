Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals that possess unique optical and electronic properties due to their small size and quantum confinement effects. These nanoparticles, typically composed of II-VI or III-V materials, range in size from 2 to 10 nanometers. Their distinct characteristics, such as size-tunable light emission, make them valuable in numerous applications, especially in electronics, photonics, and biomedical fields.

The term "cadmium-free quantum dots" refers to quantum dots that do not contain cadmium, a toxic heavy metal. These QDs are increasingly favored due to growing environmental and health concerns associated with cadmium-based alternatives. The growing interest in non-toxic, environmentally friendly quantum dots is driving innovations and applications across various industries, such as displays, lighting, and solar energy.
