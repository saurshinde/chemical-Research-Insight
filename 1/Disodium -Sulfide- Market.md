Disodium Sulfide (Na2S) is a yellowish, solid flake that has a sulfurous, rotten egg odor. While sodium sulfide can exist as Na2S, its most common form is the hydrated version, Na2S·9H2O. Both forms are highly soluble in water and create strongly alkaline solutions. Sodium sulfide is primarily produced by heating sodium sulfate with coal or hydrogen.

In its hydrated form, sodium sulfide is used across several industries due to its versatility. It is commonly utilized in the production of dyes and colors, in metallurgy, chemical synthesis, mining, and waste management. Particularly, sodium sulfide plays a significant role in the manufacturing of chemicals, including sodium hydrosulfide, and is also used in various ore processing applications. Its ability to effectively treat wastewater, soil, and process sludge is another key application, alongside its use in leather and textile industries.
