The global Large Diameter PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Pipe market refers to the industry involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of large-diameter PVC pipes, typically ranging from 600mm to over 1000mm in diameter. These pipes are primarily used in sectors such as construction, agriculture, water supply, and wastewater management. The popularity of PVC pipes is largely driven by their strength, cost-efficiency, durability, and ease of installation compared to traditional metal piping systems. PVC pipes are resistant to corrosion, making them ideal for use in a variety of environments where moisture and chemicals are a concern.

The large diameter pipes are utilized in more demanding applications, such as the transportation of large volumes of water, sewage, and industrial liquids, where smaller pipes might not suffice. The pipes are also employed in underground utility lines and in the construction of stormwater and sewage systems.
