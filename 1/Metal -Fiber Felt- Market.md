Metal Fiber Felt (RMF) is a unique depth-based filtration media known for its ability to remove particulate matter by trapping it within the structure of the filter media. The mesh used in Metal Fiber Felt is made from a variety of metallic fibers that are interwoven, pressed, heated, and bonded to form a robust, permeable material. This type of media is widely utilized in industries requiring high-performance filtration, such as petrochemical processing, automotive manufacturing, and other industrial sectors.

Metal Fiber Felt’s structure enables it to efficiently capture particles from gases and liquids while maintaining high flow rates and minimal pressure drops. This makes it an ideal solution for environments where high temperatures and corrosive conditions are common. It is widely used in both air and liquid filtration systems, and its durability and filtration efficiency have positioned it as a preferred solution in many applications.
