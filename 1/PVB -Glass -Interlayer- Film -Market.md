Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) Glass Interlayer Film is a transparent, thermoplastic resin used predominantly in laminated glass. This film is a crucial component in the manufacturing of safety glass, offering key benefits such as enhanced strength, impact resistance, UV protection, and sound insulation. PVB glass interlayer films are utilized across various industries, with primary applications in automotive windshields, architectural glazing, and specialized safety glass products such as bullet-resistant and hurricane-resistant glass.

The interlayer film serves as a binding layer between two sheets of glass, ensuring that, if the glass breaks, the pieces remain adhered to the film, thus preventing dangerous shattering. This film also contributes to noise reduction, providing acoustic insulation, which is especially useful in automotive and building applications. In the automotive industry, it plays a key role in improving vehicle safety by preventing glass fragments from flying during accidents, offering enhanced protection for passengers.
