Pharma grade sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is a specialized form of sodium bicarbonate that meets high purity standards for pharmaceutical applications. It is widely used in the healthcare sector, primarily as a pH buffering agent, systemic alkalizer, and in electrolyte replenishing formulations. The compound is used as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and excipient in various medical applications, such as treating conditions like metabolic acidosis, cardiac arrest, and severe lactic acidosis, among others. Pharma grade sodium bicarbonate is essential in hemodialysis for electrolyte balance and is often found in topical cleansing solutions.

Pharma-grade sodium bicarbonate is different from regular sodium bicarbonate, as it undergoes a stringent purification process to ensure it is free from contaminants, making it suitable for medical and pharmaceutical use. It is also used in a variety of products like antacids, tablets, and toothpaste, which contribute to its growing popularity in the healthcare market.
