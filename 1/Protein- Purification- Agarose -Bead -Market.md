Protein purification is a crucial step in various biochemical and biotechnological applications. The process of isolating a target protein from a complex mixture involves several techniques, and column chromatography is one of the most widely used methods. Column chromatography employs different types of resins or beads to separate proteins based on their specific properties. One such material is agarose, which, when used in agarose beads or resins, serves as an effective medium for protein purification.

Agarose beads are spherical particles made from agarose, a polysaccharide derived from seaweed. These beads serve as a matrix in column chromatography due to their porous structure and biocompatibility, which allows for the efficient separation and isolation of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. The beads’ ability to interact selectively with proteins under specific conditions makes them ideal for affinity purification, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography techniques.
