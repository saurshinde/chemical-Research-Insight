Pyrolytic graphite is a unique form of graphite produced through the high-temperature decomposition of hydrocarbon gases in a vacuum furnace. This process leads to the formation of ultra-pure graphite with a near-theoretical density and pronounced anisotropic properties. It is typically grown onto a substrate, resulting in a layered composition, with distinct differences in properties along different planes. The material exhibits low thermal conductivity in the C plane (across the layers), functioning as an insulator, while in the A-B plane (with the layers), it shows extremely high thermal conductivity, making it an excellent conductor. These unique properties of pyrolytic graphite make it valuable in applications such as semiconductors, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and more.
