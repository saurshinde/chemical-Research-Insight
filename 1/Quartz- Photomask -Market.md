A Quartz Photomask is an essential component in the semiconductor and display industries, acting as a template for transferring intricate circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers or substrates. These photomasks are made of high-quality quartz glass, which is favored for its excellent optical properties, including high transmittance and low thermal expansion. Quartz photomasks are vital in photolithography processes, where precise patterns are projected onto the substrate, enabling the production of semiconductors and flat-panel displays.

Quartz photomasks are categorized into two main types: synthetic quartz and ordinary quartz. Synthetic quartz offers superior durability, high precision, and better performance in extreme environments, making it more suitable for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Ordinary quartz photomasks, while still valuable, are typically used in less demanding applications.
