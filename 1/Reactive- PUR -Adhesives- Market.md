Reactive PUR (Polyurethane Reactive) adhesives, often referred to as PUR hot melt adhesives, are a type of 100% solid adhesive that cures through a chemical reaction with moisture in the air. These adhesives are primarily made using isocyanate (NCO) capped polymers, which react with ambient moisture during the curing process to form robust bonds that improve over time. The unique characteristic of PUR adhesives is their ability to maintain solid content without solvents, making them an environmentally friendly and high-performance option in various industries.

These adhesives are widely used in a variety of applications including the automotive, woodworking, textile, and architectural industries due to their strong adhesion properties, resistance to environmental factors, and flexibility. The chemical composition of PUR adhesives allows them to bond a wide range of materials such as wood, metals, plastics, and textiles.
