Recycle yarn is a type of yarn made from the recycling of waste materials such as plastic fibers, often polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and natural fibers. These fibers are recovered from post-consumer or post-industrial waste and transformed into usable yarn through various processes. This approach helps to reduce waste and minimizes the environmental impact associated with textile production, making it a sustainable alternative to conventional yarn. The process typically involves breaking down the waste materials, cleaning, and re-spinning them into new yarn, which can be used in a wide array of industries such as textiles, automotive, and construction.

Recycle yarn can be composed of different materials, including recycled PET, cotton, and nylon, and is increasingly being used to create environmentally friendly products. These yarns have applications in several industries, including apparel, carpeting, automotive interiors, and building materials, making it a versatile and eco-conscious solution for manufacturers. Recycled fibers play a key role in circular economy strategies, offering an opportunity for manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprint while meeting consumer demand for more sustainable products.
