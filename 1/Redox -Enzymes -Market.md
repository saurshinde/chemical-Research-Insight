Redox enzymes are specialized biological catalysts that play a crucial role in redox reactions, which involve the transfer of electrons between molecules. These enzymes catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, typically facilitating the process of oxidation (losing electrons) or reduction (gaining electrons) within living organisms. A common subclass of redox enzymes includes oxidases, which catalyze the oxidation of substrates by oxygen, and dehydrogenases, which facilitate the removal of hydrogen from molecules.

Redox enzymes are essential in various biochemical processes and applications, including metabolic regulation, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. These enzymes have applications in numerous industries, including food and beverage production, pharmaceuticals, animal feed, textiles, and more. Their ability to catalyze specific reactions makes them valuable in enhancing efficiency and promoting sustainable processes in these industries.
