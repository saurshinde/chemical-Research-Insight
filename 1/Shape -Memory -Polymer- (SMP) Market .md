Shape Memory Polymers (SMPs) are innovative materials that have the unique ability to return to a predefined shape when exposed to external stimuli. These stimuli can include factors such as temperature changes, exposure to light, chemicals, or electrical fields. SMPs operate based on a "shape memory" mechanism, which involves the material undergoing a transition between a temporary and permanent shape. When activated, the material "remembers" its original configuration and reverts to that shape.

In practical applications, SMPs are used in industries ranging from aerospace and biomedical to automotive and textiles. Their ability to recover shapes upon stimulus makes them ideal for products that need to adapt or change form in response to external conditions. This versatility is particularly valued in sectors that demand high-performance materials, such as implantable medical devices or aerospace components.
