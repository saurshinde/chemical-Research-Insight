Shea butter is a natural, edible fat extracted from the nuts or kernels of the Vitellaria paradoxa tree, commonly known as the shea tree. Native to West Africa, shea butter has been used for centuries for its medicinal, cosmetic, and culinary properties. Its rich content of fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants makes it highly beneficial in a variety of industries, particularly in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceuticals.

In the cosmetic industry, shea butter is prized for its ability to deeply moisturize, nourish, and protect the skin. It is commonly used as an alternative to vegetable oils in personal care products such as lotions, creams, lip balms, soaps, and hair care items. The market for shea butter in cosmetics is growing steadily due to increasing consumer demand for natural and organic skincare products. Rich in stearic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, shea butter’s fatty acid profile enhances its effectiveness as a moisturizer and emollient, making it a vital ingredient in many beauty formulations.
