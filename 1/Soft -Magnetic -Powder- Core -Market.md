Soft Magnetic Powder Cores (SMPCs) are integral components in electronic and electromagnetic applications. These cores consist of soft-magnetic metallic powders, mainly composed of iron and its alloys. The powder is often mixed with other materials like nickel, molybdenum, silicon, and more to fine-tune the properties of the core. The powders are then embedded in a binder material and pressed into shapes, but unlike traditional cores, these powders are not sintered, allowing grains to remain isolated. This characteristic leads to a distributed air gap in the core, which results in low permeability and soft saturation behavior.

The main feature of soft magnetic powder cores is their ability to efficiently handle magnetic flux with low losses. This unique composition allows them to offer adjustable permeability, ranging from 10 to 550, depending on the combination of powder composition, grain size, and particle density. These cores are primarily used in applications that require energy storage, power transformation, and signal processing, including devices such as transformers, inductors, and sensors.
