Soldering flux paste is an essential material in electronics and industrial soldering processes. It is primarily used to enhance the connection between two metals by cleaning, protecting, and facilitating the melting of the solder. In the soldering process, metals are joined using an alloy, typically made from tin combined with other elements such as lead, silver, copper, antimony, bismuth, or indium. Flux paste plays a crucial role in the soldering process by preventing oxidation of metals, improving the flow of solder, and ensuring a strong and reliable bond.

Flux paste is available in several forms, including rosin-based pastes, water-soluble fluxes, and no-clean flux, each offering distinct advantages depending on the specific requirements of the soldering task. It is primarily used in a variety of industries, including electronics manufacturing, semiconductor packaging, automotive assembly, and industrial soldering. The market for solder paste flux has been growing steadily due to the increasing demand for high-quality soldering in advanced technological products, including electronics and automobiles.
