Vacuum Bagging Release Film is an essential material used in the production and molding processes of composite materials, specifically designed to separate the resin from the mold. The primary purpose of the release film is to prevent the resin from adhering to the mold, making it easier to remove the cured composite material from the mold. This material is typically used during the composite manufacturing process, such as the production of components for aerospace, automotive, wind power generation, and other industries.

The release film plays a crucial role not only in the demolding process but also in ensuring that the surface quality of the composite product meets the necessary standards. The film provides a rough and clean surface finish, allowing for better subsequent processing such as painting, bonding, or other post-production treatments. Additionally, it is used as an intermediary layer between the product and other vacuum bagging components, making it easier to separate the vacuum bagging components once the product is cured.
