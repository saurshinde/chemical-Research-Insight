Inorganic rheology modifiers, commonly known as thickeners or flow control agents, are chemical compounds primarily used in the manufacturing of paints, coatings, cosmetics, personal care products, and various industrial applications. These modifiers play a crucial role in controlling and stabilizing the flow and viscosity of substances, ensuring desired texture, spreadability, and consistency. They are especially important in industries that require precise control over the consistency and thickness of formulations.
These modifiers include compounds such as clays, fumed silica, and other minerals that interact with the base material to increase its viscosity, improve its stability, and prevent settling or separation of ingredients. This is particularly important in industries like automotive paints, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, where consistency and quality are vital to performance.
