Medical grade Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is a highly versatile, water-soluble synthetic polymer that is widely recognized for its biocompatibility and non-toxic properties. It is especially valued for its use in the medical and pharmaceutical sectors due to its ability to simulate natural tissues. PVA offers a range of beneficial properties, such as high oxygen permeability, which makes it suitable for medical applications like tablet coatings, eye drops, and topicals. Additionally, PVA is known for its excellent film-forming capabilities, emulsifying properties, and ability to remain moist, which are crucial for certain pharmaceutical formulations.
Unlike other polymers, medical grade PVA is biocompatible, meaning it is safe for human use and does not trigger immune responses. This makes it particularly useful in drug delivery systems, where materials must be both effective and gentle on the body. It is also used in biofermentation processes, where its properties help in sustaining certain biological processes.

In essence, medical grade PVA is a key ingredient in various pharmaceutical products, serving as a reliable excipient and delivering functionality in both internal and external medical treatments.
