Metal porous filters are a class of filters made from metal powder particles that are processed using powder metallurgy techniques to create a network of interconnected pores. These filters are commonly employed in separating solids from liquids and gases, regulating fluid flow, pressure control, and in applications requiring fluid storage. Porous filters also serve as efficient barriers for contaminant removal and are versatile components in numerous industries such as the chemical, power, metallurgy, and electronics sectors.
The key products in this market include powder porous filters and sintered metal fiber filters. Powder porous filters are made by compacting metal powders under heat and pressure, resulting in a porous, solid structure with controlled porosity. Sintered metal fiber filters, on the other hand, are made by bonding metal fibers to create a highly porous filter material that offers superior filtration performance in extreme conditions.

Market Size
The global metal porous filters market size was valued at USD 278 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 373.28 million by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.30% during the forecast period.

This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for advanced filtration technologies, as industries are continuously looking for more efficient and reliable filtration systems to improve product quality and operational efficiency. As industries such as chemical manufacturing, power generation, metallurgy, and electronics continue to expand, the need for high-performance porous filters will drive further growth in this market.

In North America, the metal porous filters market was valued at USD 72.44 million in 2023, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.69% during the period from 2025 to 2030. This growth is primarily driven by the adoption of advanced filtration solutions across industries such as chemicals, power, and electronics.
