Pyrolytic Boron Nitride (PBN) is an advanced ceramic material composed of boron and nitrogen atoms arranged in a hexagonal crystal structure. It is known for its exceptional properties, including high purity (99.999%), resistance to both acids and alkalis, oxidation resistance, excellent thermal conductivity, and the ability to be machined into various forms. This material is produced through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where ammonia and boron halides are reacted under high temperature and vacuum conditions. The resulting product, PBN, is crucial in industries requiring heat resistance and excellent performance under harsh conditions.

PBN is often used in applications such as semiconductor production, OLED technology, and other high-performance materials. It can be fabricated into various products, including PBN plates, crucibles, boats, heaters, and coatings. Its remarkable properties make it ideal for specialized applications where high purity and heat resistance are required.
