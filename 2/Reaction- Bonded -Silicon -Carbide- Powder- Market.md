Reaction Bonded Silicon Carbide Powder (RBSiC Powder) is a specialized composite material that forms part of the broader family of silicon carbide (SiC) materials. Silicon carbide itself is a durable ceramic compound known for its high thermal conductivity, hardness, and strength. Reaction bonded silicon carbide is created through a process that involves infiltrating porous preforms of carbon or silicon carbide with liquid silicon at high temperatures. This chemical reaction leads to the formation of silicon carbide crystals within the structure, resulting in a strong, dense material with enhanced properties suitable for industrial applications.

RBSiC powder is used extensively in industries where high-performance materials are required, including the mining, aerospace, automotive, and chemical sectors. The powder itself is versatile and can be utilized in different forms to create components such as seals, mechanical parts, and cutting tools, often functioning in environments where extreme temperatures and high wear conditions exist.

The global market for Reaction Bonded Silicon Carbide Powder is projected to grow steadily due to increasing industrial applications and advancements in material science.
