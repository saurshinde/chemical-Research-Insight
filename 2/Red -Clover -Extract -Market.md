Red clover extract is derived from the red clover plant (Trifolium pratense), a flowering plant widely recognized for its beneficial properties. Rich in isoflavones, particularly genistein and daidzein, red clover extract is gaining popularity for its health benefits, especially in areas like menopausal symptom relief, cardiovascular health, and skin care. The extract is used in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, due to its natural bioactive components. These isoflavones, often referred to as phytoestrogens, mimic the effects of estrogen in the body, making red clover extract a sought-after ingredient for products targeting hormone balance.

The growing awareness about the potential health benefits of plant-based extracts is driving the global demand for red clover extract. As consumers increasingly seek natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals, the market for this extract is expected to see steady growth.

Market Size
The global market for red clover extract was valued at USD 86 million in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.20%, reaching an estimated USD 131.03 million by 2032. This growth reflects the rising consumer demand for plant-based health products and natural supplements. The expansion of the dietary supplement industry, combined with increased research into the therapeutic properties of isoflavones, is expected to further drive the market during the forecast period.

In North America, the red clover extract market was valued at USD 22.41 million in 2023. The region is expected to continue its growth, with a CAGR of 5.31% between 2025 and 2032, driven by a growing inclination towards natural health solutions and increasing awareness of menopause-related issues. Other regions, such as Europe and Asia-Pacific, are also expected to witness strong growth as red clover extract becomes more integrated into various wellness products.

Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)
