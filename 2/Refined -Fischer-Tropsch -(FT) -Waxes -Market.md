Refined Fischer-Tropsch (FT) Waxes are high-quality hydrocarbon compounds produced as byproducts of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process. This process involves converting carbon monoxide and hydrogen into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons, and the resulting FT waxes are further refined to meet specific industry needs. These waxes are predominantly used in various industries due to their exceptional properties, such as high melting points, low volatility, and resistance to oxidation.

The FT waxes are primarily utilized for their versatile applications across several sectors, including plastic processing, hot melt adhesives, textiles, and rubber products. These refined waxes are produced under two major types: High-Temperature Fischer-Tropsch (HTFT) and Low-Temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) waxes, each offering unique characteristics suited to different applications.

The refining process involves removing impurities from the initial FT waxes, improving their performance by enhancing features like hardness, texture, and stability. These refined products are critical in industries that demand precise chemical and physical properties, making FT waxes an important commodity in global supply chains.
