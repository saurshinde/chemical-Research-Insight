Riboflavin Kinase is an essential enzyme involved in the metabolism of riboflavin, or Vitamin B2. This enzyme is vital for the conversion of riboflavin into its active coenzyme forms: flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These coenzymes play crucial roles in the body's ability to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which ultimately produce energy and support cellular processes, such as oxygen utilization.

In the broader context, Riboflavin Kinase is instrumental in the synthesis of enzymes that impact energy production, making it an essential element in nutrition and metabolism. This market refers to the global demand, supply, and application of Riboflavin Kinase in various sectors, including food additives, animal feeding, pharmaceuticals, health supplements, and cosmetics.

Market Size
The global Riboflavin Kinase market was valued at approximately USD 724 million in 2023. The market is anticipated to expand significantly, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.50%, reaching USD 1125.09 million by 2032. This growth trajectory highlights the increasing demand for riboflavin and its active forms in various industries, fueled by growing awareness regarding the importance of Vitamin B2 in human health and wellness.

North America's Riboflavin Kinase market size was estimated at USD 188.65 million in 2023.
