Fiber-based release liners are products that play a crucial role in industries where adhesives and coatings are used. These liners are typically made from paper or plastic films coated with a release agent (often silicone) to prevent adhesion. Their primary function is to protect sticky surfaces—such as adhesives, coatings, and labels—until they are ready for use.

These products are used in a wide variety of industries, including medical, electronics, and printing, where precise adhesion is critical. The release liner prevents premature bonding or adhesion of the substrate and ensures that the sticky material performs as intended at the time of use. The market for fiber-based release liners has gained significant traction due to their essential role in packaging, medical devices, and various industrial applications.

Market Size
The global fiber-based release liner market was valued at USD 2,113 million in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 3,033.18 million by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.30% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to increasing demand in various sectors such as the medical and electronics industries, which are expected to continue expanding at a robust pace.

Historically, the market has seen steady growth, with the adoption of new materials and the need for sustainable packaging solutions driving much of the demand. With rising consumer and industrial needs for reliable, high-quality adhesive applications, the fiber-based release liner market continues to grow both in volume and market value.
