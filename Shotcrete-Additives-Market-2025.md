Shotcrete additives are specialized chemical or mineral admixtures incorporated into shotcrete to enhance its properties. Shotcrete itself is a type of concrete that is applied using high-pressure equipment, spraying the mixture onto a surface, making it a versatile option for various construction projects. The role of shotcrete additives is to improve the performance and characteristics of shotcrete, including its durability, workability, and strength. These additives can modify properties like setting time, bonding, water resistance, and cracking prevention, making the material more suitable for different applications, such as mining, tunneling, and concrete repairs.

The additives used in shotcrete can be broadly categorized into two types: liquid additives and powder additives. Liquid additives include plasticizers, retarders, accelerators, and air-entraining agents, while powder additives include fibers, pozzolanic materials, and pigments. Each of these serves a unique purpose in ensuring the overall effectiveness of the shotcrete in a given application.
